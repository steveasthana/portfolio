            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Steve and I am a student studying computer science and math at Northeastern University.
                I am currently seeking full-time entry level software development roles starting May 2024,
                with interests in data analytics/probability and finance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a co-op at the TJX Companies, where I work as a software engineer on the EBT-Finance team. Previously,
                I worked at iCorps Technologies, where I worked on the automation of previously manual reporting procedures for their clients.
                At Northeastern, I am a member of the student finance board, where I and 10 other appointed peers are responsible for 
                the budgeting of $4M+ to studnet clubs and organizations. Previously, I was chosen by my peers to serve as a Liaison to the Dean's Office
                of my college, where I had the opportunity to facilitate changes to the curriculum of computer science major requirement CS3500, Object Oriented Design.
                I graduated from Shrewsbury High School (MA) in 2020, where I was class president and a captain of the debate team.

            <h3>The TJX Companies</h3>
            <p>
                I started my 6 month co-op at the TJX Companies in July 2023 as a Software Engineer. So far, it has been great learning the tech stack and 
                helping my Agile team by taking on stories which involve the integration of a global treasury management application across all financial services.
                Additionally, I execute end-to-end testing, maintain software documetation and flow diagrams, and test NFRs for new integrations for the EBT-Finance team. 
                I have been especially excited to learn about empoying DevOps practices to build and update Oracle EBS objects on the CI/CD pipeline including GitHub, Jenkins,
                and Ansible.

            <p>
                This summer from May 2023 to August 2023, I worked at Accounting Solutions, a local accounting firm in Worcester, MA. As 
                a freelance developer, I worked on establishing a web application allowing customers to calculate an estimation for their fees 
                based on their tax forms. To do so, I held weekly code reviews until deployment. To ensure the best UX, I conducted manual testing with
                the client to ensure the application was easy to use and understand.

                which helped to streamline their business processes and save them time and resources.
                In addition to implementing scripts and code myself, 
                I lead a team of three developers to create a script incorporating previously implemented scripts with newly 
                implemented ones to create one script for all managed services for the clients under Datto.
